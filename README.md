# Flask-ML-deployment

# Introduction
 
Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It was developed by Armin Ronacher, who led a team of international Python enthusiasts called Poocco. Flask is based on the Werkzeg WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.
After Armin Ronacherâ€™s initial release of Flask in 2010, the framework has gained huge popularity over the years, and examples of popular applications that make use of Flask include LinkedIn and Pinterest. Since Flask is written in Python, it provides us Python programmers with a convenient interface for embedding existing Python code.

# Install Flask in terminal
